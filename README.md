## Overview

This module adds the ability to schedule publish and unpublish events
at a certain date and time. It can be applied to different model classes,
but is commonly used with `SiteTree` where it comes with built-in UI triggers.

Features:

 * Date and time picker (through SilverStripe CMS, where browsers [support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) it)
 * Publish "windows" by setting a publish date with a subsequent unpublish date
 * Scheduled publication through [queuedjobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs)
 * Respects cascading publish through [ownership relations](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/model/versioning/#dataobject-ownership)
 * Expiry unpublishes the page (leaves it in "draft" mode)
 * Optionally lock editing while publication is scheduled
 * Add status flags to pages in the tree
 * Support for translations in [silverstripe/fluent](https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent)

## Requirements

 * SilverStripe 4.0
 * [Queuedjobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs)

## Installation

Install with Composer:

```
composer require silverstripe-terraformers/embargo-expiry
```

## Configuration

Add the following YAML configuration (e.g. in `mysite/_config/embargo.yml`):

```yml
SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\CMSMain:
  extensions:
    - Terraformers\EmbargoExpiry\Extension\EmbargoExpiryCMSMainExtension
```

Then add the extension to the `DataObject` classes you want to have embargoed.
At the moment, this module only supports `SiteTree`.

```yml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  extensions:
    - Terraformers\EmbargoExpiry\Extension\EmbargoExpiryExtension
```

Now run a `dev/build` in your browser,
or from the command line via `vendor/bin/sake dev/build`.

Finally, ensure you've set up [queuedjobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs) correctly
to execute your jobs periodically.

## Known Issues

 * Does not support recurring embargo or expiry schedules
 * Does not support multiple concurrent schedules for the same object
 * Does not support embargo to a particular live version
 * Does not support expiry to an earlier live version
 * Any edits to an embargoed page will be published on the date (not tied to a version)
